# Responsive Portfolio

I found this homework difficult at the start, I wanted to change a lot of the CSS but had to remove a fair bit as we weren't meant to change too much. I had to change the CSS for the images though as they weren't lining up correctly.

I think I'll need to keep practising using bootstrap as I prefered to write the CSS myself.

Over all I think I did pretty well for my first personal website.

Lots of study and using google to get certain things to work like the social media links.

I removed a few tags that didn't need to be there but I keep getting an error message when I use the validator it says Start tag body seen but an element of the same type was already open. 

I tried googling this and I wasn't sure what it meant? If you could please let me know that would be very helpful.
